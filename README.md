## Hi there, I'm David Iriondo | Backend developer 👋

*Good software isn’t about languages, but about solid design, systems thinking, architecture, and execution*

### About me 👨‍💻
- I'm working in IT since I was 25 and currently specializing in **Cloud Computing and Cloud Architecture** 
- In my free time I like to workout, hiking, swimming, any activity outside of the office
- I'm learning to play guitar inspired by arctic mokeys, my favorite band
- I've decided to start publishing my personal projects. Many of them are based on my professional experience. Also I have a blog where I'll talk about technology related topics, projects, and random subject.
